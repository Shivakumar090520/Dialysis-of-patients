# Dialysis-of-patients

Project Overview:
This project involved working with a dataset of 14,000+ records spread across two tables. I performed an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process to clean and prepare the data for analysis. Additionally, I created data models by mapping and linking similar columns across the tables.

Key KPIs Identified:

Number of patients across various summaries
Profit vs. non-profit statistics
Total performance score (categorized as 'No Score')
Top 5 dialysis stations
Number of categories with text matching expected outcomes
Average payment reduction rate
